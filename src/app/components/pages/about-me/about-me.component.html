        My IT trip started in 2017, when I joined Beetroot Academy courses of 'Front End'.
        Of course, obtained knowledge was not enough for join some company. But I didn't gived up and continued to find a job.
        <br>
        <br>
        I made close to 20 test tasks before found a stable job. My first position was a HTML Coder.
        At first everything was good, but after some period I understood that my growing stopped in one point
        and somewhat need's to change.
        <br>
        <br>
        I went to new 'React.js' courses, but at second time obtained knowledge was not enough to find new job.
        Little bit later I received an interesting opportunity to join US startup on Angular2. First three months
        I worked as trainee, but after became a junior FE Dev.
        <br>
        <br>
        It was a nice game, but in long period of work without rest
        and lack of career growth I decided to change vector.
