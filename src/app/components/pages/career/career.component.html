        <span>
            I've been working in a US startup on a large Angular2 (v8-v13+) SPA.
            Specialize in UI design implementation, creating UI components, extending existing UI components,
            refactoring existing UI components to achieve better layout flexibility, developing
            HTML architecture of components, developing component styles and app-wide themes,
            developing adaptive and responsive layouts, and troubleshooting UI bugs.
            Using TypeScript, RxJS, decorators, directives, and pipes with Angular.
            Using the SCSS preprocessor for component styles, including mixins, variables, etc.
            Typically I use Angular Material elements or creating custom components for UI components
            but also comfortable using any third-party UI-kits, like Nebular and etc.

            My main work contained in optimization and creating landing pages. The main part was a work with legacy code
            and smaller part - in creating landings. General work was with HTML structure, styling via CSS / SCSS
            and using libraries on jQuery / JS.

            It was a wild time. I coded how I could and how I couldn't. First time I did test tasks.
            Sometimes that tasks were paid. After I had partial success and received several offers;
            my experience was not enough for long-term cooperation.
